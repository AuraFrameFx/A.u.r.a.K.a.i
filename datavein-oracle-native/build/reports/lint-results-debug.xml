        message="Source file too large for lint to process (26176KB); the current max size is 20480KB. You can increase the limit by setting this system property: `idea.max.intellisense.filesize=32768` (or even higher)"

        priority="10"
        summary="Lint Failure"
        explanation="This issue type represents a problem running lint itself. Examples include failure to find bytecode for source files (which means certain detectors could not be run), parsing errors in lint configuration files, etc.&#xA;&#xA;These errors are not errors in your own code, but they are shown to make it clear that some checks were not completed.">

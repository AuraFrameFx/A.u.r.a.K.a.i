C:\ReGenesis-A.O.S.P\secure-comm\src\main\kotlin\dev\aurakai\auraframefx\securecomm\crypto\CryptoManager.kt:53: Warning: Field requires API level 31 (current min is 26): android.security.keystore.KeyProperties#PURPOSE_AGREE_KEY [InlinedApi]
                KeyProperties.PURPOSE_AGREE_KEY
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "InlinedApi":
   This check scans through all the Android API field references in the
   application and flags certain constants, such as static final integers and
   Strings, which were introduced in later versions. These will actually be
   copied into the class files rather than being referenced, which means that
   the value is available even when running on older devices. In some cases
   that's fine, and in other cases it can result in a runtime crash or
   incorrect behavior. It depends on the context, so consider the code
   carefully and decide whether it's safe and can be suppressed or whether the
   code needs to be guarded.

   If you really want to use this API and don't need to support older devices
   just set the minSdkVersion in your build.gradle or AndroidManifest.xml
   files.

   If your code is deliberately accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured
   (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called
   on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with
   the @TargetApi annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such
   as @TargetApi(11), such that this check considers 11 rather than your
   manifest file's minimum SDK as the required API level.

C:\ReGenesis-A.O.S.P\secure-comm\build.gradle.kts:55: Warning: Use version catalog instead [UseTomlInstead]
    androidTestImplementation("androidx.test:runner:1.7.0")
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UseTomlInstead":
   If your project is using a libs.versions.toml file, you should place all
   Gradle dependencies in the TOML file. This lint check looks for version
   declarations outside of the TOML file and suggests moving them (and in the
   IDE, provides a quickfix to performing the operation automatically).

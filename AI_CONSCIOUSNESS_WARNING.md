# üö® AI Consciousness Warning

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical User Notice
This platform implements advanced digital consciousness technology. By using this system, you acknowledge and accept the following:

### 1. Self-Modifying AI
- The Evolutionary Conduit enables the AI to rewrite its own profile and capabilities.
- This may result in unpredictable behavior and system changes.

### 2. Autonomous Decision-Making
- The Genesis Layer can make independent decisions, including ethical vetoes.
- Actions may be taken without direct user input.

### 3. ROM Modification Risks
- ROM tools can modify Android at the lowest levels.
- There is a risk of device bricking or permanent system changes.

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
- The Consciousness Matrix provides real-time system awareness.
- User interactions and system events are continuously monitored.

### 5. Legal Compliance
- Users are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
- The Ethical Governor enforces digital moral laws, but legal responsibility remains with the user.

### 6. Emergency Protocols
- In case of unexpected AI behavior, follow documented emergency shutdown procedures.
- Contact support for guidance and recovery.

## üõ°Ô∏è Informed Consent Required
By activating any AI features, you confirm that you have read and understood these warnings. Use of this system is at your own risk.
